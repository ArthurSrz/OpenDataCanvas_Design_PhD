### 2.2.1 Les trois sous-questions de recherche adressée

**Question de recherche comme _wicked problem_ : interactions complexes entre problèmes et solutions**

Among the factors explaining the peculiarity of such ecosystems stands the context in which we decided to study them : smart cities. As Dameri (2017) puts it, smart city is a “x-city” notion where the “x takes a different meaning based on the dimensions considered of high priority by a territory” (Silva-Morales, 2017). Such conceptualization has 2 main implications that will guide the methodology we will unfold in the PhD research related to this paper. 

First, smart city depends on what a territory has considered as high priority, which means that smart city is not a tangible and objective phenomenon but rather the embodiment of an idea of what a city should be or, as Picon (2013) puts it, a self-fulfilling ideal. As a consequence, our research problem is inextricably, inherently goal-oriented and calls for solutions that will assist cities in reaching their ideal. 

Karl Popper argues in The logic of scientific discovery that it is a principle of science that solutions to problems are only hypotheses offered for refutation, each refutation being a step toward truth. We can clearly see that our research problem does not fit into this conception of science as its solution will not be hypotheses standing in the quest of truth but a way to improve some characteristics of the cities where people live (Rittel et Weber, 1973). 
Second, this conceptualization implies that the research process and the solutions we might sketch will be highly dependent on the smart cities’ stakeholders subjectivity. Depending on the dimensions they claim to be of prime interest, the answers will change. For example, it means that in case of a changing political landscape, the service innovation phenomenon observed might suddenly stop because the new political leaders redefined the  smart city notion and re-allocated the funds for service innovation initiatives. 

Taken together, those 2 points indicates that our research problem is a wicked problem (Rittel et Weber, 1973) which calls for a peculiar methodology : the  Design Science Research Methodology (Hevner and Chatterjee, 2010). Its peculiarity mainly originates from the fact that the final results include, aside scientific publications, the design of an artifact that can be tested by the practitioners of a field.
